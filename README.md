# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

This project was created as an iteractive study guide for course pre-work. It will make taking notes more effective, as editing the notes impiments the practices of the programming profession and solves the problem of a lack of physical repitition. It was an introduction to Git, Git hub, and JavaScript for me, and a refresher of HTML and CSS, but in a new environment.
